# Multi-Agent Orchestration with MCP Task Manager

The MCP Task Manager provides advanced support for **multi-agent orchestration environments** where multiple AI agents collaborate on complex projects with interdependent tasks.

## ðŸŽ¯ Essential Reading for Agents

**Before using the MCP Task Manager, all agents should review the [Agent Best Practices Guide](./docs/guides/agent-best-practices.md)** which provides proven methodologies for:

- **Effective Task Creation**: Investigation, action planning, and exit criteria definition
- **Quality Execution**: Research-driven approach with continuous progress updates
- **Core Methodology**: Plan and reflect, use tools (don't guess), persist until complete

These practices ensure maximum effectiveness and quality outcomes when using the task management tools.

## Key Features

### ðŸ¤– Agent-Friendly Design

- **Smart Parameter Preprocessing**: Automatically converts string numbers, JSON arrays, and boolean strings
- **Enhanced Error Messages**: Clear, actionable feedback with suggestions and examples
- **Fuzzy Enum Matching**: Intelligent suggestions for typos and partial matches

### ðŸ”— Dependency Management

- **Task Dependencies**: Set up complex task relationships with prerequisite management
- **Ready Task Discovery**: Find tasks that are unblocked and ready for parallel execution
- **Circular Dependency Prevention**: Automatic detection and prevention of invalid dependencies

### ðŸ“Š Workflow Analysis

- **DAG Visualization**: ASCII, DOT (Graphviz), and Mermaid format dependency graphs
- **Critical Path Analysis**: Identify bottlenecks and optimize workflow efficiency
- **Progress Tracking**: Monitor completion status across distributed agent workflows

## Core Orchestration Tools

### 1. `set_task_dependencies`

Set up task relationships and prerequisites for workflow management.

```json
{
  "name": "set_task_dependencies",
  "arguments": {
    "listId": "web-app-project",
    "taskId": "deploy-frontend",
    "dependencyIds": ["build-ui", "run-tests", "code-review"]
  }
}
```

### 2. `get_ready_tasks`

Find tasks ready for execution (no incomplete dependencies).

```json
{
  "name": "get_ready_tasks",
  "arguments": {
    "listId": "web-app-project",
    "limit": 5
  }
}
```

### 3. `analyze_task_dependencies`

Analyze project structure, critical paths, and bottlenecks with DAG visualization.

```json
{
  "name": "analyze_task_dependencies",
  "arguments": {
    "listId": "web-app-project",
    "format": "both",
    "dagStyle": "ascii"
  }
}
```

## Multi-Agent Workflow Patterns

### Parallel Feature Development

Multiple teams working on different features simultaneously with proper dependency management.

### Pipeline Processing

Sequential stages with parallel work within each stage, ideal for content creation and approval workflows.

### Quality Gates

Multiple approval processes with parallel reviews before deployment or publication.

### Specialized Agent Teams

- **Frontend Agents**: UI components, styling, user experience
- **Backend Agents**: APIs, business logic, database integration
- **Testing Agents**: Unit tests, integration tests, end-to-end tests
- **DevOps Agents**: Infrastructure, deployment, monitoring
- **Documentation Agents**: API docs, user guides, technical documentation

## Benefits for Multi-Agent Systems

- **Increased Throughput**: Multiple agents work in parallel on independent tasks
- **Optimal Resource Utilization**: No agent waits unnecessarily for blocked tasks
- **Intelligent Scheduling**: Automatic identification of the most impactful work
- **Scalable Coordination**: Handles complex projects with hundreds of interdependent tasks
- **Fault Tolerance**: Failed tasks don't block unrelated work streams

## Use Cases

- **Large Development Projects** with multiple specialized AI agents
- **Content Creation Pipelines** with writers, editors, and publishers
- **Research Projects** with data collection, analysis, and reporting agents
- **Business Process Automation** with multiple workflow participants

## Getting Started

1. **Install the MCP Task Manager**: `npm install -g task-list-mcp`
2. **Configure your MCP client** to connect to the task manager server
3. **Create a project list** and add tasks with dependencies
4. **Use orchestration tools** to coordinate multiple agents
5. **Monitor progress** with dependency analysis and ready task discovery

## MCP Tools

The MCP Task Manager provides a comprehensive set of tools for task and list management through the Model Context Protocol. These tools enable AI agents to create, manage, and orchestrate complex workflows.

### Task Management Tools

- `add_task` - Add new tasks to lists
- `complete_task` - Mark tasks as completed
- `remove_task` - Remove tasks from lists
- `update_task` - Update task properties and metadata
- `show_tasks` - Display tasks with filtering options
- `search_tool` - Search across tasks and lists with advanced filtering

### List Management Tools

- `create_list` - Create new task lists
- `get_list` - Retrieve list details and tasks
- `list_all_lists` - Show all available lists
- `delete_list` - Remove lists and their tasks

### Advanced Orchestration Tools

- `set_task_dependencies` - Define task relationships and prerequisites
- `get_ready_tasks` - Find tasks ready for execution
- `analyze_task_dependencies` - Generate dependency graphs and critical path analysis

- `bulk_task_operations` - Perform batch operations on multiple tasks

### Task Enhancement Tools

- `add_task_tags` - Add metadata tags to tasks
- `remove_task_tags` - Remove metadata tags from tasks
- `set_task_priority` - Set task priority levels
- `set_task_exit_criteria` - Define completion criteria
- `update_exit_criteria` - Modify task completion requirements
