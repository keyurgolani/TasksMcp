# System Health Improvement Specification

## Overview

This specification outlines a comprehensive system health improvement initiative to refactor every source, test, and configuration file in the project according to the utmost standards and quality guidelines defined in the coding-practices.md steering document.

## Objectives

1. **Code Quality Excellence**: Achieve zero TypeScript errors, zero warnings, and strict compliance
2. **Architectural Consistency**: Implement domain-driven architecture throughout the codebase
3. **Testing Excellence**: Achieve 95% line coverage and 90% branch coverage with comprehensive test suites
4. **Standards Compliance**: Ensure all code follows coding practices and design patterns
5. **System Cleanup**: Remove prohibited features and implement required functionality
6. **Documentation Quality**: Maintain current, accurate, and comprehensive documentation

## Scope

### Files to be Reviewed and Refactored

- All source files in `src/` directory
- All test files in `tests/` directory
- All configuration files (`package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `eslint.config.js`, `vitest.config.ts`)
- All documentation files (`README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `docs/`)
- All script files in `scripts/` directory

### Exclusions

- Files in `.kiro/` directory (protected)
- Files in `node_modules/` directory
- Generated files in `dist/` and `coverage/` directories

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation Assessment and Setup

#### 1.1 Current State Analysis

- Audit all source files for coding standard violations
- Identify architectural inconsistencies
- Document current test coverage gaps
- List prohibited features that need removal
- Catalog required features that need implementation

#### 1.2 Tooling and Configuration Setup

- Install and configure test coverage dependencies
- Update linting configuration to be stricter
- Configure TypeScript for strict mode compliance
- Set up automated validation scripts

### Phase 2: Code Quality Remediation

#### 2.1 TypeScript Compliance

- Enable strict mode in `tsconfig.json`
- Remove all `@ts-ignore` and `@ts-expect-error` comments
- Replace all `any` types with proper typing
- Fix all TypeScript compilation errors and warnings
- Ensure strict null checks and no implicit any

#### 2.2 Linting and Formatting

- Fix all ESLint violations
- Remove all `eslint-disable` comments
- Apply consistent formatting with Prettier
- Enforce import ordering and code organization
- Implement stricter linting rules progressively

#### 2.3 Naming Convention Enforcement

- Enforce kebab-case for file names
- Enforce PascalCase for class names
- Enforce camelCase for functions and variables
- Enforce PascalCase for interfaces (no I prefix)
- Enforce SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE for constants
- Remove fluff qualifiers and redundant type information

### Phase 3: Architectural Refactoring

#### 3.1 Domain-Driven Architecture Implementation

- Create Configuration Management domain
- Reorganize MCP Tools domain with consolidated schema
- Implement Application Model domain for all entities
- Create Core Orchestration domain for CRUD operations
- Establish Data Delegation domain for multiple backing stores
- Implement Data Access domain for storage implementations
- Create REST API domain parallel to MCP tools

#### 3.2 File Recreation and Migration

- Recreate files from scratch when moving between domains
- Write unit tests from scratch for each recreated file
- Delete original files only after new versions are tested
- Ensure proper domain boundaries and separation of concerns

#### 3.3 Prohibited Feature Removal

- Remove monitoring and alerting systems completely
- Remove intelligence features (suggestions, complexity analysis)
- Remove statistics management and caching systems
- Remove task ordering features (use dependency-based only)
- Remove archiving functionality (permanent deletion only)
- Remove bulk operations from MCP server

### Phase 4: Testing Excellence

#### 4.1 Test Structure Organization

- Ensure unit tests mirror source code directory structure
- Create one unit test file per source code file
- Implement integration tests in each domain directory
- Create end-to-end tests for all application interfaces

#### 4.2 Coverage Achievement

- Achieve minimum 95% line coverage per unit test
- Achieve minimum 90% branch coverage per unit test
- Configure coverage to test only intended directories
- Fix all failing tests and investigate flaky tests thoroughly

#### 4.3 Test Quality Assurance

- Ensure each test file is executable independently
- Implement proper setup, mocks, and teardown
- Close all spawned threads to prevent memory leaks
- Use timeout commands for all test executions

### Phase 5: Feature Implementation

#### 5.1 Required Feature Development

- Implement agent prompt template system
- Add circular dependency detection and prevention
- Create comprehensive search and filter capabilities
- Implement modern tag validation (emoji, uppercase, unicode)
- Add task status management functionality
- Create list metadata management tools

#### 5.2 System Improvements

- Add blockReason field for dependency information
- Implement remove_task_tags tool
- Make dependencyIds parameter optional
- Improve error messages with context and guidance
- Add ability to clear dependencies and exit criteria

### Phase 6: Documentation and Cleanup

#### 6.1 Documentation Updates

- Update all documentation to reflect new architecture
- Remove documentation for deleted features
- Update installation and configuration guides
- Ensure examples use correct terminology and patterns

#### 6.2 Workspace Cleanup

- Remove temporary files and backup files
- Clean up dead code and unused dependencies
- Ensure workspace organization and cleanliness
- Maintain only necessary files

## Quality Gates

### Code Quality Gates

- Zero TypeScript compilation errors
- Zero TypeScript compilation warnings
- Zero ESLint errors or warnings
- All tests passing with required coverage
- No prohibited patterns in codebase

### Architectural Gates

- Proper domain boundaries maintained
- No direct data store access from handlers
- All features use orchestration layer
- Domain-driven directory structure implemented

### Testing Gates

- 95% line coverage achieved
- 90% branch coverage achieved
- All test files executable independently
- No flaky tests remaining

### Documentation Gates
