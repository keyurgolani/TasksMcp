# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines a comprehensive system health improvement initiative for the Task MCP Unified application. The project aims to transform the existing codebase into a production-ready, enterprise-grade system that follows industry best practices, implements domain-driven architecture, and provides a complete multi-interface solution (MCP, REST API, and React UI) for task management.

The system will undergo a complete architectural overhaul while maintaining backward compatibility for existing functionality. The improvements focus on code quality, testing methodology, architectural patterns, user experience, and operational excellence.
