## üõ†Ô∏è Usage and Features

### Q: How many tools are available?

**A:** The MCP Task Manager provides **20 focused tools** organized in 6 categories:

- **List Management** (4 tools): Create, retrieve, list, delete
- **Task Management** (6 tools): Add, update, remove, complete, priorities, tags
- **Search & Display** (3 tools): Search, filter, formatted display
- **Advanced Features** (2 tools): AI analysis and suggestions
- **Exit Criteria Management** (2 tools): Quality control and completion tracking
- **Dependency Management** (3 tools): Task relationships and workflow optimization

### Q: What's the difference between priority levels?

**A:** Priority levels use a 1-5 scale:

- **5 (Critical)**: Urgent, blocking other work, immediate attention required
- **4 (High)**: Important, time-sensitive, should be done soon
- **3 (Medium)**: Normal priority, regular tasks (default)
- **2 (Low)**: Nice to have, when time permits
- **1 (Minimal)**: Optional, lowest priority, someday/maybe

### Q: What are exit criteria and why should I use them?

**A:** Exit criteria are specific requirements that must be met before a task can be completed. They provide:

- **Quality Control**: Ensure tasks meet standards before completion
- **Progress Tracking**: See exactly what's done and what remains
- **Team Alignment**: Clear expectations for "done"
- **Prevent Rework**: Catch issues before tasks are marked complete

Example:

```json
{
  "exitCriteria": [
    "All unit tests pass with >90% coverage",
    "Code review completed by senior developer",
    "Documentation updated"
  ]
}
```

### Q: How do task dependencies work?

**A:** Task dependencies define prerequisite relationships:

- **Set Dependencies**: Use `set_task_dependencies` to define what must be completed first
- **Automatic Resolution**: System automatically tracks when dependencies are met
- **Ready Tasks**: Use `get_ready_tasks` to find tasks available to work on
- **Circular Detection**: System prevents circular dependency loops
- **Visualization**: Use `analyze_task_dependencies` to see the project structure

### Q: Can I work on multiple projects simultaneously?

**A:** Yes! The system supports unlimited projects:

- **Project Tags**: Organize lists by project using `projectTag`
- **Cross-Project Search**: Search across all projects or filter by specific projects
- **Resource Management**: Track work across multiple projects
- **Portfolio View**: Use `list_all_lists` to see all active projects

## üîç Advanced Features

### Q: What is the unified search tool?

**A:** The `search_tool` is a powerful unified interface that replaces separate search and filter tools:

- **Text Search**: Find tasks by title, description, or tags
- **Advanced Filtering**: Filter by status, priority, tags, dependencies
- **Cross-List Search**: Search across all projects or specific lists
- **Dependency-Based Ordering**: Tasks are ordered by dependency completion
- **Pagination**: Handle large result sets efficiently

**Recommendation**: Use `search_tool` instead of the legacy search and filter tools.

### Q: What are bulk operations and when should I use them?

**A:** Bulk operations have been removed from MCP tools and are only available through the REST API. They allow you to perform multiple actions in a single request:

**Use Cases (REST API only):**

- **Sprint Setup**: Create multiple tasks at once (via REST API)
- **Priority Updates**: Adjust priorities for multiple tasks (via REST API)
- **Status Changes**: Mark multiple tasks as complete (via REST API)

**Note**: For MCP clients, use individual tool calls for each operation.

- **Cleanup**: Remove or archive multiple completed tasks

**Benefits:**

- **Efficiency**: Fewer API calls
- **Consistency**: Atomic operations with rollback
- **Performance**: Faster than individual operations

### Q: How does the DAG visualization work?

**A:** DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) visualization shows task dependencies in multiple formats:

- **ASCII Format**: Human-readable text-based graph
- **DOT Format**: Graphviz-compatible for external rendering
- **Mermaid Format**: Diagram-as-code for documentation

**Use Cases:**

- **Project Planning**: Visualize project structure
- **Bottleneck Identification**: Find tasks blocking others
- **Team Coordination**: Share project structure visually
- **Progress Tracking**: See completion status graphically

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Q: I'm getting validation errors. What's wrong?

**A:** The MCP Task Manager includes smart parameter preprocessing, but some common issues:

**Priority Errors:**

```json
// ‚ùå Wrong
{"priority": "high"}

// ‚úÖ Correct
{"priority": 5}

// üîÑ Auto-converted
{"priority": "5"}  // Automatically becomes 5
```

**UUID Errors:**

```json
// ‚ùå Wrong
{"listId": "abc-123"}

// ‚úÖ Correct
{"listId": "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000"}
```

**Array Errors:**

```json
// ‚ùå Wrong
{"tags": "urgent,important"}

// ‚úÖ Correct
{"tags": ["urgent", "important"]}

// üîÑ Auto-converted
{"tags": "[\"urgent\", \"important\"]"}  // JSON string converted
```

### Q: My tasks show as "blocked". What does this mean?

**A:** Tasks are blocked when they have incomplete dependencies:

1. **Check Dependencies**: Use `get_list` to see what's blocking the task
2. **Complete Prerequisites**: Finish the blocking tasks first
3. **Find Ready Tasks**: Use `get_ready_tasks` to see what you can work on now
4. **Remove Dependencies**: Use `set_task_dependencies` with empty array if dependencies are no longer needed

### Q: Can I undo operations like deleting tasks or lists?

**A:** Currently, the system provides:

- **Permanent Delete**: Lists are permanently deleted when requested
- **Backup System**: Automatic backups for data recovery
- **Task Removal**: Tasks are removed but lists maintain history

**Future Enhancement**: Full undo/redo functionality is planned for future versions.
