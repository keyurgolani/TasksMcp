## Step 2: Choose Your MCP Client

### Option A: Claude Desktop (Recommended for AI Conversations)

Claude Desktop provides the most natural conversational interface for task management.

#### 2.1 Locate Configuration File

- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/mcp.json`
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%/Claude/mcp.json`

#### 2.2 Add Configuration

Create or edit the file with this configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "task-manager": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/REPLACE/WITH/YOUR/PATH/task-list-mcp/dist/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "NODE_ENV": "production",
        "STORAGE_TYPE": "file",
        "DATA_DIRECTORY": "./claude-tasks"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Important**: Replace `/REPLACE/WITH/YOUR/PATH/task-list-mcp` with your actual path:

```bash
# Get your current path
pwd
# Copy this path and use it in the configuration
```

#### 2.3 Restart Claude Desktop

Close and reopen Claude Desktop to load the new configuration.

### Option B: Kiro IDE (Recommended for Development)

Kiro IDE provides excellent integration for development workflows.

#### 2.1 Create Workspace Configuration

In your workspace, create `.kiro/settings/mcp.json`:

```bash
# Create the directory
mkdir -p .kiro/settings

# Create the configuration file
cat > .kiro/settings/mcp.json << 'EOF'
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "task-manager": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["./dist/index.js"],
      "cwd": "/REPLACE/WITH/YOUR/PATH/task-list-mcp",
      "env": {
        "NODE_ENV": "development",
        "STORAGE_TYPE": "file",
        "DATA_DIRECTORY": "./.kiro/task-data"
      },
      "disabled": false,
      "autoApprove": [
        "create_todo_list",
        "get_todo_list",
        "update_todo_list",
        "list_todo_lists",
        "delete_todo_list",
        "analyze_task_complexity",
        "search_todo_lists"
      ]
    }
  }
}
EOF
```

#### 2.2 Restart Kiro IDE

Restart Kiro or reload the MCP server configuration.

## Step 3: Your First Todo List

Now let's create your first todo list! We'll walk through this with both Claude Desktop and Kiro IDE.

### With Claude Desktop

Open Claude Desktop and start a new conversation:

```
Hi! I'd like to create a todo list for learning the MCP Task Manager. Can you help me set up a list with some basic learning tasks?
```

Claude should respond by creating a todo list. Here's what happens behind the scenes:

1. Claude analyzes your request
2. Uses the `create_todo_list` tool
3. Creates a structured list with appropriate tasks
4. Returns the list details with ID and progress tracking

### With Kiro IDE

In Kiro, you can use the MCP tools directly:

```javascript
// Create your first todo list
const result = await mcp_task_manager_create_todo_list({
  title: "Learning MCP Task Manager",
  description: "Tasks to master the MCP Task Manager system",
  context: "learning",
  tasks: [
    {
      title: "Complete the getting started tutorial",
      description: "Follow the step-by-step tutorial",
      priority: 5,
      estimatedDuration: 60,
      tags: ["tutorial", "learning"]
    },
    {
      title: "Create a project todo list",
      description: "Set up a real project with tasks",
      priority: 4,
      estimatedDuration: 30,
      tags: ["practice", "project"]
    },
    {
      title: "Try task complexity analysis",
      description: "Use AI to analyze and break down complex tasks",
      priority: 4,
      estimatedDuration: 45,
      tags: ["ai", "analysis"]
    },
    {
      title: "Explore advanced features",
      description: "Learn about dependencies, filtering, and search",
      priority: 3,
      estimatedDuration: 90,
      tags: ["advanced", "features"]
    }
  ]
});

console.log('Created todo list:', result);
```

## Step 4: Understanding Your Todo List

Let's examine what was created. Your todo list includes:

### Basic Information
- **ID**: Unique identifier for the list
- **Title**: "Learning MCP Task Manager"
- **Description**: Brief description of the list purpose
- **Context**: "learning" (helps organize related lists)

### Tasks
Each task has:
- **Title**: What needs to be done
- **Description**: Additional details
- **Status**: Current state (pending, in_progress, completed, blocked, cancelled)
- **Priority**: 1-5 scale (5 = highest priority)
- **Created/Updated timestamps**: When the task was created and last modified
- **Tags**: Labels for organization and filtering
- **Estimated Duration**: Time estimate in minutes

### Analytics
- **Total Items**: Number of tasks in the list
- **Completed Items**: Number of finished tasks
- **Progress**: Completion percentage (0-100%)
- **Real-time metrics**: Velocity, completion rates, etc.

## Step 5: Managing Tasks

Now let's learn how to manage your tasks effectively.

### 5.1 Viewing Your Todo List

**With Claude Desktop:**
```
Show me my learning todo list with current progress
```

**With Kiro IDE:**
```javascript
// Get the todo list (replace with your actual list ID)
const listId = "your-list-id-here";
const todoList = await mcp_task_manager_get_todo_list({
  listId: listId,
  includeCompleted: true
});

console.log(`Progress: ${todoList.progress}% (${todoList.completedItems}/${todoList.totalItems})`);
console.log('Tasks:');
todoList.items.forEach((item, index) => {
  const status = item.status === 'completed' ? '‚úÖ' : '‚è≥';
  console.log(`${index + 1}. ${status} ${item.title} (Priority: ${item.priority})`);
});
```

### 5.2 Updating Task Status

Let's mark the first task as completed:

**With Claude Desktop:**
```
I've finished the getting started tutorial. Please mark that task as completed.
```

**With Kiro IDE:**
```javascript
// Update task status to completed
const updatedList = await mcp_task_manager_update_todo_list({
  listId: "your-list-id",
  action: "update_status",
  itemId: "your-task-id",
  itemData: {
    status: "completed"
  }
});

console.log(`Updated! Progress is now ${updatedList.progress}%`);
```

### 5.3 Adding New Tasks

**With Claude Desktop:**
```
Add a new task to my learning list: "Set up automated backups" with high priority
```

**With Kiro IDE:**
```javascript
// Add a new task
const updatedList = await mcp_task_manager_update_todo_list({
  listId: "your-list-id",
  action: "add_item",
  itemData: {
    title: "Set up automated backups",
    description: "Configure automatic backup system for task data",
    priority: 4,
    estimatedDuration: 45,
    tags: ["setup", "backup", "maintenance"]
  }
});

console.log(`Added new task! List now has ${updatedList.totalItems} tasks`);
```

## Step 6: AI-Powered Task Analysis

One of the most powerful features is AI-powered task complexity analysis. Let's try it!

### 6.1 Analyze a Complex Task

**With Claude Desktop:**
```
I need to build a web application with user authentication, a dashboard, and real-time notifications. Can you analyze the complexity and create a project plan?
```

**With Kiro IDE:**
```javascript
// Analyze task complexity
const analysis = await mcp_task_manager_analyze_task_complexity({
  taskDescription: "Build a web application with user authentication, dashboard, and real-time notifications using React, Node.js, and WebSocket",
  context: "web-development",
  autoCreate: true,
  generateOptions: {
    style: "technical",
    maxTasks: 10,
    includeTests: true,
    includeDependencies: true
  }
});

console.log(`Complexity Score: ${analysis.analysis.complexity.overall}/10`);
console.log(`Confidence: ${(analysis.analysis.confidence * 100).toFixed(1)}%`);
console.log(`Estimated Duration: ${Math.round(analysis.analysis.estimatedDuration / 60)} hours`);

if (analysis.autoCreated) {
  console.log(`Created project plan: ${analysis.createdList.title}`);
  console.log(`Generated ${analysis.createdList.totalItems} tasks`);
}
```

### 6.2 Understanding the Analysis

The AI analyzes multiple factors:

- **Technical Complexity** (9/10): Multiple technologies, authentication, real-time features
- **Scope** (8/10): Large application with multiple components
- **Dependencies** (7/10): Sequential development phases
- **Risk** (6/10): Integration challenges and potential issues

Based on this analysis, it automatically creates a structured project plan with:
- Architecture and planning tasks
- Development phases
- Testing and validation steps
- Deployment and monitoring tasks

## Step 7: Advanced Features

### 7.1 Task Dependencies

You can create tasks that depend on other tasks:

```javascript
// Create a task that depends on another task
await mcp_task_manager_update_todo_list({
  listId: "your-list-id",
  action: "add_item",
  itemData: {
    title: "Deploy to production",
    description: "Deploy the application to production environment",
    priority: 3,
    dependencies: ["testing-task-id", "security-review-task-id"],
    tags: ["deployment", "production"]
  }
});
```

### 7.2 Filtering and Search

Find specific tasks across all your lists:

```javascript
// Search for tasks related to testing
const searchResults = await mcp_task_manager_search_todo_lists({
  query: "testing",
  filters: {
    status: ["pending", "in_progress"],
    priority: [4, 5]
  },
  sorting: {
    field: "priority",
    direction: "desc"
  }
});

console.log(`Found ${searchResults.totalCount} testing tasks`);
```

### 7.3 List Management

Organize your work with multiple lists:

```javascript
// List all your todo lists
const allLists = await mcp_task_manager_list_todo_lists({
  context: "learning",
  status: "active"
});

console.log(`You have ${allLists.length} active learning lists`);
allLists.forEach(list => {
  console.log(`- ${list.title}: ${list.progress}% complete`);
});
```

## Step 8: Best Practices

### 8.1 Organizing with Contexts

Use contexts to group related projects:

- `learning` - Educational and tutorial projects
- `work` - Professional projects
- `personal` - Personal tasks and goals
- `project-name` - Specific project contexts

### 8.2 Effective Task Writing

**Good task titles:**
- ‚úÖ "Implement user authentication with JWT"
- ‚úÖ "Write unit tests for user service"
- ‚úÖ "Deploy application to staging environment"

**Poor task titles:**
- ‚ùå "Fix stuff"
- ‚ùå "Work on project"
- ‚ùå "Do things"

### 8.3 Priority Guidelines

- **Priority 5 (Critical)**: Blockers, urgent deadlines, critical bugs
- **Priority 4 (High)**: Important features, scheduled deliverables
- **Priority 3 (Medium)**: Regular development tasks, improvements
- **Priority 2 (Low)**: Nice-to-have features, optimizations
- **Priority 1 (Minimal)**: Documentation, cleanup, future ideas

### 8.4 Using Tags Effectively

Organize tasks with meaningful tags:

- **Type tags**: `bug`, `feature`, `documentation`, `testing`
- **Technology tags**: `react`, `nodejs`, `database`, `api`
- **Status tags**: `urgent`, `blocked`, `review-needed`
- **Area tags**: `frontend`, `backend`, `devops`, `design`

## Step 9: Monitoring Progress

### 9.1 Regular Reviews

Check your progress regularly:

**With Claude Desktop:**
```
Show me a summary of all my active projects and their progress
```

**With Kiro IDE:**
```javascript
// Get progress summary
const allLists = await mcp_task_manager_list_todo_lists({
  status: "active"
});

console.log("üìä Progress Summary:");
console.log("==================");

let totalTasks = 0;
let completedTasks = 0;

allLists.forEach(list => {
  totalTasks += list.totalItems;
  completedTasks += list.completedItems;
  
  console.log(`${list.title}: ${list.progress}% (${list.completedItems}/${list.totalItems})`);
});

const overallProgress = totalTasks > 0 ? Math.round((completedTasks / totalTasks) * 100) : 0;
console.log(`\nOverall Progress: ${overallProgress}% (${completedTasks}/${totalTasks} tasks)`);
```

### 9.2 Identifying Bottlenecks

Look for:
- Tasks stuck in "in_progress" status for too long
- High-priority tasks that haven't been started
- Tasks with unmet dependencies
- Lists with low completion rates
