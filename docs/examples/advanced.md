# Advanced Workflow Examples

This document demonstrates advanced features including AI-powered analysis, dependency management, and multi-agent orchestration patterns, all following the [Agent Best Practices](../guides/agent-best-practices.md) methodology.

## üéØ Advanced Methodology Integration

These examples demonstrate the three core principles in complex scenarios:

- **Plan and Reflect**: Deep analysis and investigation for complex projects
- **Use Tools, Don't Guess**: Comprehensive research and validation approaches
- **Persist Until Complete**: Quality assurance through detailed exit criteria and progress tracking

## Methodology-Driven Complex Project Planning

### Investigation-First Approach for Complex Tasks

**Step 1: Initial Task Analysis (Plan and Reflect)**

```json
{
  "tool": "analyze_task",
  "parameters": {
    "taskDescription": "Build a real-time chat application with WebSocket support, user authentication, message persistence, and file sharing capabilities",
    "context": "Web application development project using Node.js and React. Team has 3 developers, 8-week timeline, needs to support 1000+ concurrent users.",
    "maxSuggestions": 5
  }
}
```

**Step 2: Research Existing Similar Work (Use Tools, Don't Guess)**

```json
{
  "tool": "search_tool",
  "parameters": {
    "query": "chat application websocket authentication",
    "includeCompleted": true,
    "sortBy": "updatedAt",
    "limit": 10
  }
}
```

**Step 3: Analyze Project Dependencies**

```json
{
  "tool": "analyze_task_dependencies",
  "parameters": {
    "listId": "current-project-id",
    "format": "analysis"
  }
}
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "isComplex": false,
  "complexityScore": 4,
  "confidence": 25,
  "estimatedDuration": 732,
  "reasoning": "Task appears straightforward (score: 4/10). Can likely be completed as a single task.",
  "suggestions": [],
  "breakdown": ["Technical complexity: 8/10 - Requires programming expertise"]
}
```

}
```

## Multi-Agent Orchestration

### Pattern 1: Parallel Feature Development

**Setup: Create feature tasks with dependencies**

```json
{
  "tool": "add_task",
  "parameters": {
    "listId": "web-app-project",
    "title": "Implement user authentication",
    "tags": ["backend", "security"],
    "dependencies": ["setup-database"]
  }
}
```

```json
{
  "tool": "add_task",
  "parameters": {
    "listId": "web-app-project",
    "title": "Design user interface",
    "tags": ["frontend", "ui"],
    "dependencies": ["create-wireframes"]
  }
}
```

**Orchestration: Find ready tasks**

```json
{
  "tool": "get_ready_tasks",
  "parameters": { "listId": "web-app-project", "limit": 5 }
}
```

**Returns:** `["setup-database", "create-wireframes"]` - can be assigned to different agents

**Assignment:**

- Database Agent ‚Üí "setup-database"
- Design Agent ‚Üí "create-wireframes"
- Both work in parallel, unlocking more tasks when complete

### Pattern 2: Pipeline Processing

**Setup: Content creation pipeline**

```json
{
  "tool": "set_task_dependencies",
  "parameters": {
    "listId": "content-pipeline",
    "taskId": "publish-article",
    "dependencyIds": [
      "write-draft",
      "edit-content",
      "create-graphics",
      "seo-review"
    ]
  }
}
```

**Orchestration: As each stage completes, next becomes ready**

- Stage 1: Writer Agent ‚Üí "write-draft"
- Stage 2: Editor Agent ‚Üí "edit-content" (after draft complete)
- Stage 3: Designer Agent ‚Üí "create-graphics" (parallel with editing)
- Stage 4: SEO Agent ‚Üí "seo-review" (after content ready)
- Stage 5: Publisher Agent ‚Üí "publish-article" (after all complete)

### Pattern 3: Quality Gates

**Setup: Code deployment with multiple approvals**

```json
{
  "tool": "set_task_dependencies",
  "parameters": {
    "listId": "deployment",
    "taskId": "deploy-production",
    "dependencyIds": [
      "code-review-1",
      "code-review-2",
      "security-scan",
      "performance-test"
    ]
  }
}
```

**Orchestration: Multiple review agents work in parallel**

- Review Agent 1 ‚Üí "code-review-1"
- Review Agent 2 ‚Üí "code-review-2"
- Security Agent ‚Üí "security-scan"
- Performance Agent ‚Üí "performance-test"
- All must complete before deployment agent can proceed

## Complex Workflow Examples

### Large Software Development Project

```bash
# Orchestration Agent Workflow:

# 1. Analyze current project state
analyze_task_dependencies ‚Üí Identify bottlenecks and critical path

# 2. Find available work
get_ready_tasks ‚Üí Get list of unblocked tasks

# 3. Assign tasks to specialized agents:
# - Frontend Agent: UI components (if design complete)
# - Backend Agent: API endpoints (if database ready)
# - Testing Agent: Unit tests (if code available)
# - DevOps Agent: Infrastructure (if requirements defined)

# 4. Monitor progress and reassign as tasks complete
# 5. Repeat until project completion
```

### Content Creation Pipeline

```bash
# Multi-Agent Content Workflow:

# 1. Content Manager Agent sets up pipeline
set_task_dependencies ‚Üí Define content workflow stages

# 2. Find ready content pieces
get_ready_tasks ‚Üí Identify articles ready for next stage

# 3. Assign to specialized agents:
# - Research Agent: Gather information and sources
# - Writing Agent: Create initial drafts
# - Editing Agent: Review and improve content
# - SEO Agent: Optimize for search engines
# - Publishing Agent: Format and publish

# 4. Pipeline flows automatically as each stage completes
```

## Performance Optimization

### Batch Operations

**Create Multiple Related Tasks:**

```json
{
  "tool": "bulk_task_operations",
  "parameters": {
    "listId": "11b0dfb3-9580-42ea-afba-208b5e44877d",
    "operations": [
      {
        "type": "create",
        "data": {
          "title": "Set up user authentication API",
          "priority": 5,
          "tags": ["backend", "auth", "api"],
          "estimatedDuration": 180
        }
      },
      {
        "type": "create",
        "data": {
          "title": "Implement JWT token handling",
          "priority": 4,
          "tags": ["backend", "auth", "security"],
          "estimatedDuration": 120
        }
      },
      {

        "data": {
          "title": "Add password hashing and validation",
          "priority": 4,
          "tags": ["backend", "auth", "security"],
          "estimatedDuration": 90
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Update Multiple Task Priorities:**

```json
{
  "tool": "bulk_task_operations",
  "parameters": {
    "listId": "11b0dfb3-9580-42ea-afba-208b5e44877d",
    "operations": [
      {
        "type": "set_priority",
        "taskId": "task-id-1",
        "priority": 5
      },
      {
        "type": "set_priority",
        "taskId": "task-id-2",
        "priority": 4
      },
      {
        "type": "add_tags",
        "taskId": "task-id-3",
        "tags": ["urgent", "client-facing"]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Best Practices for Advanced Workflows

### Task Design

- **Atomic Tasks**: Create tasks that can be completed independently by a single agent
- **Clear Dependencies**: Only set dependencies that represent true prerequisites
- **Balanced Workload**: Design tasks with similar complexity for parallel execution

### Dependency Management

- **Minimize Dependencies**: Reduce coupling between tasks where possible
- **Parallel Paths**: Create multiple independent work streams
- **Critical Path Focus**: Prioritize tasks on the critical path

### Multi-Agent Coordination

- **Role-Based Assignment**: Assign tasks based on agent specialization
- **Progress Monitoring**: Regular check-ins on task completion status
- **Dynamic Rebalancing**: Reassign work based on agent availability and progress
