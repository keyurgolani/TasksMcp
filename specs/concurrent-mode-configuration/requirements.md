# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds concurrent mode configuration support to the MCP Task Manager, enabling the system to adapt its behavior based on whether it's operating in a multi-agent environment or single-agent environment. The configuration determines default behavior for task status filtering and prioritization, particularly for in-progress tasks, while maintaining explicit override capabilities for agents.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to configure the MCP server for concurrent mode operation, so that multiple AI agents can work together efficiently without interfering with each other's task execution.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the MCP_CONCURRENT_MODE environment variable is set to "true" THEN the system SHALL operate in concurrent mode
2. WHEN the MCP_CONCURRENT_MODE environment variable is set to "false" or not set THEN the system SHALL operate in single-agent mode
3. WHEN concurrent mode is enabled THEN the system SHALL assume multiple agents may be executing tasks simultaneously
4. WHEN single-agent mode is enabled THEN the system SHALL assume one agent executes tasks sequentially
5. WHEN the configuration is changed THEN the system SHALL require a restart to apply the new mode

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an AI agent in a concurrent environment, I want the system to exclude in-progress tasks from ready task lists by default, so that I don't interfere with tasks being executed by other agents.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN operating in concurrent mode AND querying ready tasks THEN the system SHALL exclude in-progress tasks by default
2. WHEN operating in concurrent mode AND an agent requests ready tasks THEN only pending tasks with no incomplete dependencies SHALL be returned
3. WHEN operating in concurrent mode AND multiple agents query ready tasks simultaneously THEN each SHALL receive non-overlapping task recommendations
4. WHEN operating in concurrent mode AND a task is marked in-progress THEN it SHALL be immediately excluded from subsequent ready task queries
5. WHEN operating in concurrent mode AND filtering tasks by status THEN in-progress tasks SHALL be treated as unavailable for new work

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an AI agent in a single-agent environment, I want the system to include in-progress tasks in ready task lists by default, so that I can resume tasks that were interrupted due to context window limitations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN operating in single-agent mode AND querying ready tasks THEN the system SHALL include in-progress tasks by default
2. WHEN operating in single-agent mode AND an agent requests ready tasks THEN in-progress tasks SHALL be prioritized first in the response
3. WHEN operating in single-agent mode AND multiple in-progress tasks exist THEN they SHALL be ordered by creation date (oldest first)
4. WHEN operating in single-agent mode AND both pending and in-progress tasks are ready THEN in-progress tasks SHALL appear before pending tasks
5. WHEN operating in single-agent mode AND an agent resumes work THEN it SHALL be guided to complete in-progress tasks before starting new ones

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an AI agent, I want to explicitly control whether in-progress tasks are included in ready task queries, so that I can override the default behavior when needed for specific workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an agent calls get-ready-tasks with includeInProgress=true THEN in-progress tasks SHALL be included regardless of concurrent mode setting
2. WHEN an agent calls get-ready-tasks with includeInProgress=false THEN in-progress tasks SHALL be excluded regardless of concurrent mode setting
3. WHEN an agent calls get-ready-tasks without specifying includeInProgress THEN the system SHALL use the default behavior based on concurrent mode
4. WHEN an agent calls filter-tasks with explicit status filters THEN the concurrent mode SHALL not affect the filtering behavior
5. WHEN an agent needs to see all tasks regardless of status THEN explicit parameters SHALL always override default concurrent mode behavior

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an AI agent, I want clear visibility into the concurrent mode configuration and its effects, so that I can understand why certain tasks are or aren't available for execution.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an agent queries system status THEN the concurrent mode setting SHALL be included in the response
2. WHEN ready tasks are filtered due to concurrent mode THEN the response SHALL indicate the filtering reason
3. WHEN an agent requests task suggestions THEN the system SHALL consider concurrent mode in its recommendations
4. WHEN concurrent mode affects task availability THEN agents SHALL receive clear explanations in tool responses
5. WHEN debugging task availability issues THEN the concurrent mode setting SHALL be logged with relevant operations

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the concurrent mode configuration to integrate seamlessly with existing MCP tools, so that all task management functionality respects the multi-agent coordination settings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using get-ready-tasks tool THEN concurrent mode SHALL affect default task filtering behavior
2. WHEN using filter-tasks tool THEN explicit parameters SHALL override concurrent mode defaults
3. WHEN using show-tasks tool THEN concurrent mode SHALL not affect display formatting but may affect default filtering
4. WHEN using analyze-task-dependencies tool THEN concurrent mode SHALL be considered in dependency analysis and recommendations
5. WHEN using get-task-suggestions tool THEN concurrent mode SHALL influence the types of tasks suggested for execution
