# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds external database persistence capabilities to the MCP Task Manager, specifically PostgreSQL support. The system will maintain backward compatibility with the existing file-based storage while providing a configurable database option for production deployments. The development environment will include automated PostgreSQL setup for seamless local development.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to configure the MCP server to use PostgreSQL as the persistence layer, so that I can deploy the application with enterprise-grade data storage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the MCP_DATABASE_URL environment variable is set THEN the system SHALL use PostgreSQL for all data persistence operations
2. WHEN the MCP_DATABASE_URL environment variable is not set THEN the system SHALL fall back to file-based storage using the existing MCP_TASKS_DIR configuration
3. WHEN connecting to PostgreSQL THEN the system SHALL validate the connection on startup and log connection status
4. WHEN PostgreSQL connection fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages with troubleshooting guidance
5. WHEN using PostgreSQL THEN the system SHALL maintain the same API interface as the file-based storage

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the development environment to automatically provision a PostgreSQL instance, so that I can develop and test database features without manual database setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running in development mode THEN the system SHALL provide scripts to start a local PostgreSQL instance
2. WHEN the development PostgreSQL instance starts THEN it SHALL automatically create the required database and schema
3. WHEN development scripts are executed THEN they SHALL configure appropriate environment variables for local database connection
4. WHEN the development database is initialized THEN it SHALL be ready to accept MCP Task Manager operations without additional setup
5. WHEN development mode is used THEN the PostgreSQL instance SHALL use non-conflicting ports and data directories

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to configure database connection parameters through environment variables, so that I can deploy the application in different environments without code changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN MCP_DATABASE_URL is provided THEN the system SHALL parse connection parameters (host, port, database, username, password)
2. WHEN individual database environment variables are provided (MCP_DB_HOST, MCP_DB_PORT, MCP_DB_NAME, MCP_DB_USER, MCP_DB_PASSWORD) THEN the system SHALL use them to construct the connection
3. WHEN both MCP_DATABASE_URL and individual variables are provided THEN MCP_DATABASE_URL SHALL take precedence
4. WHEN database configuration is invalid THEN the system SHALL fail fast with descriptive error messages
5. WHEN database connection parameters change THEN the system SHALL require a restart to apply new settings

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to connect to an external PostgreSQL database with pre-existing schema, so that I can use managed database services or existing database infrastructure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts with PostgreSQL configuration THEN it SHALL connect to the external database endpoint
2. WHEN connecting to the external database THEN it SHALL assume the required tables and schema already exist
3. WHEN the database connection is established THEN it SHALL support all existing MCP Task Manager data structures (lists, tasks, dependencies)
4. WHEN database operations are performed THEN they SHALL maintain ACID properties for data consistency
5. WHEN the application cannot connect to the external database THEN it SHALL provide clear error messages about connection failures

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user of the MCP Task Manager, I want all existing functionality to work identically regardless of the storage backend, so that I can switch between file and database storage without losing features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using PostgreSQL storage THEN all 18 MCP tools SHALL function identically to file-based storage
2. WHEN switching storage backends THEN the API responses SHALL maintain the same format and structure
3. WHEN performing task operations THEN dependency management SHALL work consistently across storage backends
4. WHEN using database storage THEN performance SHALL be comparable or better than file-based storage
5. WHEN errors occur THEN error handling and recovery SHALL work consistently across storage backends

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive logging and monitoring for database operations, so that I can troubleshoot issues and monitor performance in production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN database operations are performed THEN they SHALL be logged with appropriate detail levels
2. WHEN database errors occur THEN they SHALL be logged with full context and stack traces
3. WHEN database connections are established or lost THEN connection events SHALL be logged
4. WHEN database queries are slow THEN performance warnings SHALL be logged
5. WHEN database health checks are performed THEN results SHALL be logged and made available through monitoring endpoints
